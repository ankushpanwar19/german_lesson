# 💕 Valentine's Experience - Customization Guide

## Quick Start: Find & Replace These Placeholders

Open `index.html` and use Find & Replace (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) to customize:

### 1. Personal Names
- **`[YOUR_NAME]`** → Your name (e.g., "John")
- **`[WIFE_NAME]`** → Your wife's name (e.g., "Sarah")

### 2. Photo & Music
- **`IMG_9298.jpg`** → Replace this file with your own romantic photo
  - Keep the same filename OR update the `src="IMG_9298.jpg"` in the HTML
  - Recommended: A special photo of you two together
  - The image will display beautifully with rounded corners above the date details
  
- **`GehraHua.mp3`** → Romantic background music (already set up!)
  - Place this file in the same folder as `index.html`
  - Music plays automatically after "Loading Next Level" (Phase 2 - proposal)
  - Volume set to 50% for comfortable listening
  - Loops continuously
  - Mute button available in top-right corner

### 3. Date Details
- **`[RESTAURANT_NAME]`** → Name of restaurant
  - Example: "Kronenhalle Restaurant"
- **`[DATE_TIME]`** → Date and time
  - Example: "February 14th, 2026 at 7:00 PM"
- **`[MAP_LINK]`** → Google Maps URL
  - Example: "https://maps.google.com/?q=Kronenhalle+Zurich"

### 4. Love Letter
- **`[YOUR_LOVE_MESSAGE]`** → Your personal message
  - Example: "My dearest Sarah, every moment with you is a treasure. I can't wait to create more beautiful memories together. You make my world brighter every single day. Forever yours, John"

### 5. Audio (Optional - Success Sound Only)
- **Background Music**: Already configured! `GehraHua.mp3` plays automatically in Phase 2
- **`[SUCCESS_SOUND_URL]`** → URL to celebration sound (optional)
  - Example: "https://yourdomain.com/success-chime.mp3"

   - `GehraHua.mp3` (romantic background music)
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
4. Share the file with your wife or host it online

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Test First**: Replace placeholders and test before the big reveal
- **Music Setup**: Place `GehraHua.mp3` in the same folder as `index.html` - it will play automatically when the proposal appears!

- **Scrollable**: Success page is scrollable if content is long - fits all screen sizes
- **Screenshot Safe**: Take screenshots of placeholder sections before editing
- **Image Format**: Works with JPG, PNG, or any web-compatible image format

2. **Phase 2**: After "Loading Next Level..." → Romantic music starts playing 🎵 + Floating hearts & flowers appear + Surprise Valentine proposal with impossible-to-click "Nein" button
3. **Phase 3**: Massive confetti, date details, and love letter reveal
